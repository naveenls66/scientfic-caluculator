Task 3 : Scientific Calculator in java

Description :

A scientific calculator in Java is a program that provides advanced mathematical functions beyond basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These advanced functions may include trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, exponential functions, and others.

To implement a scientific calculator in Java, you will need to create a user interface that allows the user to input mathematical expressions and displays the results. You can use a GUI framework like Swing or JavaFX to create the user interface.

The program should be able to handle both simple and complex mathematical expressions. It should parse the input expression and evaluate it using the appropriate mathematical functions. You can use libraries like Jep, MathEclipse, or Apache Commons Math to handle the parsing and evaluation of mathematical expressions.

In addition to the basic arithmetic operations, the calculator should provide buttons or functions for advanced mathematical operations like square root, logarithm, exponentiation, trigonometric functions, and others. These functions can be implemented using the Java Math library, which provides a wide range of mathematical functions.

The user interface should also allow the user to perform operations like clearing the display, backspace, and memory functions like saving and recalling values.

Overall, a scientific calculator in Java involves creating a user interface, parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions, implementing advanced mathematical functions, and handling user input. It requires knowledge of Java programming, GUI frameworks, and advanced mathematical concepts.
